# WeMeta
Overview of WeMeta. 

## Narrative
Data is the fuel for intelligence, which is the basis of security and performance. Most data is unavailable to organizations due to complex retrieval, preprocessing and streaming schemas associated with that data. It is very difficult for an origination to understand themselves. If they try to, massive security concerns can arise, making it risky to promote data availability even within organizations who have optimized their collective intelligence.
WeMeta is a managed Data Availability (DA) platform and layer layer that creates scenius. With a combination of onchain and offchain data, teams are able to monitor applications, projects, competitors and more, without lift or maintenance, in a secure environment.

#### Example
Alex is a partnerships success manager at a leading blockchain ecosystem. Alex is tasked with monitoring 50+ projects and partners to ensure their success and foster a symbiotic relationship with his organization. 
There is currently no way for him to do this without making cuts. That is, Alex is forced to monitor limited insights in order to gauge success, he must isolate metrics or shuffle between platforms to understand his success or lack thereof. Moreover, Alex is unable to share specific or generalized observations with other teams within his organization without significant lift -- he can send a screenshot in an email, not the workbook in a Slack group.
With WeMeta Alex is able to monitor applications, projects, competitors and more without lift or maintenance, in a secure environment. Alex is able to draw and share insights from realtime understanding of his ecosystem, compare it to other ecosystems, and optimize the success of his partners and organization.

## Traction
WeMeta has solved these problems for Decentraland builders, and been integrated into Decentraland's SDK.
WeMeta's MVP infrastructure has been used by virtually every web3 metaverse developer.
WeMeta's data has shown a 93% leading Pearson correlation to price. That is really high, and means WeMeta can virtually nail tomorrow's price with data that no one else has. 
How good is a 93% correlation? The CTO of Ledger, Charles Guillemet, found that inflows / outflows of BTC into the newly approved Bitcoin ETFs has a 86% correlation with price.

## Go To Market
Go to Market strategy and plan
Sign blockchain ecosystems as clients
Integrate into applications and protocols within those ecosystems

## Revenue Model
WeMeta generates revenue by operating as a staker / validator of the networks and applications we work with. In the event they do not have a decentralized network, we operate a SaaS model.

## Network
WeMeta's ZK L2 enables applications to roll up to any chain and utilizes GPU acceleration to provide light speed data availability at a fraction of the cost. 
Querying data this way has enabled ETL of over 30GB in a second, for example, which means ecosystems can monitor thousands of applications in real time.
Native yield (ETH, MATIC, AVAX, SOL, and more)
Any (approved) token can be used for gas
GPU acceleration to be the fastest chain and combination of onchain and offchain data
